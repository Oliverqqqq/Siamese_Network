## Introduction

This project was done as a part of my coursework for Data Manipulation unit. The propose of this project is to investigate and visualise the Uber pickups data. The dataset contains over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April 2014 to September 2014.

The files in the Dataset are separated by month and each has the following columns:  
* Date/Time: the data and time of the Uber pickup  
* Lat:The latitude of the Uber pickup  
* Lon:The longitude of the Uber pickup  
* Base:a code affiliated with the Uber pickup

## Task
1. Analysze and visualise the Uber Pick ups data according to the time, day and month.

2. Show how the number of pick-up vary per day of the week, per month per hour of the day according to location.
